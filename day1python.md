## Execute Python Syntax

Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line
print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

## Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

## Python Variables

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Example 
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

**Python has no command for declaring a variable.**

## Comments
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Example 
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

## Multiline Comments

Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")

## Python Variables

### Variables 
Variables are containers for storing data values.

#### Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

## How to get the type of variable
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
