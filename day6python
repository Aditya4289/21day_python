## Functions can Return a Boolean
You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:

example--
Print the answer of a function:

def myFunction() :
  return True

print(myFunction())
output -true

## You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:
Example
Print "YES!" if the function returns True, otherwise print "NO!":

def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")
output - YES!

### Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:

Example
Check if an object is an integer or not:

x = 200

print(isinstance(x, int))
output - true

# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
print(10 + 5)
output - 15

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators
